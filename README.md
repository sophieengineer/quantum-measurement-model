Many-body simulations investigating the emergence of objectivity as a result of closed system equilibration. 

The results of these simulations appear [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18016).

- The jupyter notebook `equilibration_error.ipynb` generates the data and figures that are presented in Fig. 3 of the manuscript.
- `SBS_functions.py` is a file containing all the relevant functions for the simulations.
- `test_SBS_functions.py` contains unit testing for a selection of functions in `SBS_functions.py`
